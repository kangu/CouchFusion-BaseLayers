# Implementation Documentation – Layers README Overview

## Initial Prompt
Create a README.md file for the "layers" folder which details how they are implemented in a nuxt app and what layers are current available

## Implementation Summary
Documented layer usage patterns and catalog in layers/README.md so Nuxt apps know how to extend shared functionality.

## Documentation Overview
- Authored `layers/README.md` describing how to wire shared layers into Nuxt apps, including `nuxt.config.ts` examples and guidance on module setup JSON generated by the CLI.
- Catalogued the current layer inventory (Analytics, Auth, Content, Database, ImageKit, Lightning, Orders) with concise capability summaries.

## Implementation Examples
- `layers/README.md:1` outlines integration steps and lists each layer with its responsibilities.
- The available layers table highlights where to find further documentation under each `layers/<name>/docs` directory.

# Array Initial Collapsed State

- [x] For the `jsonarray` and `stringarray` types inside the node builder, provide collapse/expand functionality through a minimal switching icon on the interface that shows how many items the array contains when collapsed.
- [x] Ensure all arrays are initially collapsed and expand only when the user toggles them, keeping the editor area compact by default.

# Array Initial Collapsed State

- [x] For the `jsonarray` and `stringarray` types inside the node builder, provide collapse/expand functionality through a minimal switching icon on the interface that shows how many items the array contains when collapsed.
- [x] Ensure all arrays are initially collapsed and expand only when the user toggles them, keeping the editor area compact by default.

- [x] Integrate the "Add item" and Expand elements into a unified toolbar-like area. Keep the Add item button at the top and not after the last item.
- [x] When pressing the Add item button, show a polished dialog that lists available insertion points with clear previews so users can choose where the new element should be inserted.

- [x] Ensure the insert-point dialog is capped at 100vh and supports vertical scrolling so large arrays remain easy to navigate.

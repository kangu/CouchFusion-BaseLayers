- [x] I am looking for the optimal way to implement optional margins on all the elements rendered through
ContentRenderer. Investigate how to do this better? Props on each components supporting margins?

- [x] Ideally it would be nice to have a dedicated Margins section in the node editor for the values of the margin(s),
so not to crowd the props and slots of a component.

- [x] Propose an implementation plan and await for my input.

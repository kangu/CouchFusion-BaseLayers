# Testing Plan – Phase 1 Progress

## Initial Prompt
```
Proceed with Phase 1 of the testing implementation plan. Mark the progress as it happens in the testing_plan document which has moved to layers/content/docs/specs/testing_plan.md
```

## Implementation Summary
Implementation Summary: Completed Phase 1 by cataloguing content-layer endpoints, defining shared fixtures, and recording results in docs/testing/content-layer-phase1-inventory.md while updating the testing plan checklist.

## Documentation Overview
- Authored `docs/testing/content-layer-phase1-inventory.md` capturing endpoint inventory, auth prerequisites, helper dependencies, and canonical fixtures for upcoming test suites.
- Updated `layers/content/docs/specs/testing_plan.md` with checkboxes that mark Phase 1 tasks complete and reference the new documentation.
- Highlighted required CouchDB session roles, filesystem touchpoints, and sample payloads to streamline Phase 2 environment bootstrapping.

## Implementation Examples
- `docs/testing/content-layer-phase1-inventory.md:1` — Phase 1 inventory with endpoint table and fixture references.
- `layers/content/docs/specs/testing_plan.md:5` — Phase 1 checklist now marked complete with citation to the new doc.

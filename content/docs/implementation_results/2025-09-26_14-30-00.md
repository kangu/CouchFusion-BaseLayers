# Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in layers/content/docs/specs/proper_json_props.md. Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time. 
Ask me for anything that after evalulation, you are not so sure what decision to make. Strive for minimal impact on other areas of the applicaiton. Any time your confidence for taking an actions is < 80%, ask for clarification.

# Plan
1. Review current builder handling for `json` props and confirm deserialisation/serialisation behaviour.
2. Normalise JSON props in the workbench and upgrade the node editor UI with validation so arrays can be edited comfortably.
3. Update the spec and documentation to record the new workflow.

# Implementation Summary
Refined the builder so `json` props are parsed into structured data on load, edited via a validated JSON textarea, and saved back as objects/arrays instead of stringified blobs.

# Next Steps
- Run through the builder UX with existing pages to confirm legacy stringified values are auto-parsed without data loss.
- Explore a richer array/object editor (beyond raw JSON) for frequently edited props if authors need additional guidance.

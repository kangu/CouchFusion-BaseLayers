# Initial Prompt
Make sure the downloaded files have the .json and can be properly saved to disk by the browser

# Plan
1. Sanitize and normalize the debug export filename and guarantee a `.json` suffix.
2. Update the Playwright download assertion to verify the extension.

# Implementation Summary
- Refined the save helper in `app/components/builder/Workbench.vue` to normalize the document id, collapse repeated hyphens, fall back to `builder-debug`, and always append `.json`, while setting the blob MIME to `application/json;charset=utf-8`.
- Playwright test (`tests/e2e/builder.spec.ts`) now checks the suggested filename contains the sanitized id and ends with `.json` (case-insensitive).

# Next Steps
- None beyond the previously noted requirement to unblock Nuxt port 5015 before running the suite locally.

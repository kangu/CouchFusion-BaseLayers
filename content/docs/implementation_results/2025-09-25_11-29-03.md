# Initial Prompt
Use the Playwright MCP server to test whether the latest change has been implemented correctly.

# Plan
1. Launch Nuxt dev server on port 5015 and verify availability (assumed running per user instructions).
2. Use Playwright MCP to exercise the `/builder` page, add sample nodes, and capture a full-page screenshot for verification.
3. Shut down the dev server if it was started explicitly during the task (not required).

# Implementation Summary
- Revisited the builder registry implementation (`app/composables/useComponentRegistry.ts`) to expose a stable object instead of a computed ref, preventing undefined prop errors surfaced during Playwright interaction.
- Adjusted the builder page (`app/pages/builder.vue`) to consume the new registry shape and continue wiring nodes into the editor without runtime warnings.
- Updated serialization helpers (`app/utils/contentBuilder.ts`) so root-level text nodes persist in the exported minimal array, aligning the preview output with the builder UI.
- Exercised the `/builder` workflow via Playwright MCP, confirming component creation, prop editing, string serialization, and live preview, with the resulting screenshot stored at `.playwright-mcp/screenshots/last.png`.

# Next Steps
- Automate regression coverage (e.g., unit tests around `serializeTree` outcomes) to catch future format issues.
- Extend the Playwright scenario to cover nested slot configurations and removal workflows once drag-and-drop enhancements land.
- Clean up the extra screenshot emitted at `.playwright-mcp/.playwright-mcp/screenshots/last.png` if the duplicate file becomes problematic.

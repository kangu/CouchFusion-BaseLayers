# Initial Prompt
Capture Playwright coverage for root reordering + spacing selection to prevent regressions. Create tests that can be ran later to ensure nothing gets broken.

# Plan
1. Extend tooling configuration so Playwright tests can run in a consistent environment (`playwright.config.ts`, npm script).
2. Author an end-to-end test covering root node reordering and spacing preset selection on `/builder`.
3. Document the addition and reference how to execute the new test suite.

# Implementation Summary
- Added `playwright.config.ts` with a Nuxt dev webServer hook, chrome desktop project, and baseURL/trace defaults to standardize future runs.
- Updated `package.json` with a `test:e2e` script for easy invocation of Playwright tests.
- Created `tests/e2e/builder.spec.ts`, which exercises root-level drag-and-drop (via dropzone) and spacing preset changes, asserting serialized output order and preview class updates.

# Next Steps
- Execute `npm run test:e2e` once dependencies are installed to verify the suite end-to-end.
- Expand coverage for slot nesting and additional layout options once the UI supports them.
- Consider adding CI wiring so the Playwright suite runs automatically on pull requests.

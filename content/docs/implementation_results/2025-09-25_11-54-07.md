# Initial Prompt
Refactor the Serialize Output section to include the full page document and not just the content nodes.

# Plan
1. Update the computed serialization output to emit the complete page document instead of only the body nodes.
2. Verify the change remains aligned with recent page configuration work.

# Implementation Summary
- Adjusted `serializedJson` in `app/pages/builder.vue` to stringify the full document returned by `createDocumentFromTree`, so the UI now reflects id/path/seo/navigation metadata along with body nodes.

# Next Steps
- Consider adding a copy-to-clipboard action or formatted preview to ease exporting the document JSON.
- Update forthcoming Playwright coverage to assert the presence of page-level keys in the serialized output.

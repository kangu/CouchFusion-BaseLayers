# Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in docs/specs/initial_config_load.md. Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time.

# Plan
1. Introduce prop-driven initialization with local state cloning, plus a JSON import pathway for debugging data.
2. Ensure the imported configuration hydrates page metadata, layout spacing, and builder nodes.
3. Add Playwright coverage that exercises the import path with dummy data.
4. Update the spec and log the implementation work.

# Implementation Summary
- Extracted the builder experience into `app/components/builder/Workbench.vue`, which accepts an optional `initialDocument`, clones it, and exposes a "Load Debug Data" button wired to a JSON file input.
- Added deserialization helpers that rebuild `BuilderTree`, page configuration, and layout spacing from a `MinimalContentDocument`, so imported data rehydrates all sections seamlessly.
- Updated `app/pages/builder.vue` to render the new workbench component, keeping the route lean.
- Extended the Playwright suite (`tests/e2e/builder.spec.ts`) with a debug-import scenario that verifies page inputs, spacing classes, serialized output, and rendered nodes after loading a sample document.
- Annotated `docs/specs/initial_config_load.md` with completion notes for initialization, import, and testing milestones.

# Next Steps
- Resolve the local port contention so `npm run test:e2e -- builder` can execute end-to-end; the current attempt failed because Nuxt couldn’t secure port 5015.
- Consider surfacing import errors in the UI (toast/message) instead of console logging when JSON parsing fails.
- Add optional REST-loading entry points once backend endpoints are defined.

# Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in layers/content/docs/specs/project_specific_component_registry.md. Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time. 
Ask me for anything that after evalulation, you are not so sure what decision to make. Strive for minimal impact on other areas of the applicaiton. Any time your confidence for taking an actions is < 80%, ask for clarification.

# Plan
1. Refactor the content layer registry so shared defaults stay in the layer while project definitions are loaded dynamically.
2. Add a bitvocation-demo component definition file supplying the non-default builder entries.
3. Update the spec with completion markers and write the required documentation artifacts.

# Implementation Summary
Separated the builder's default text/slot components from project overrides by loading `~/content-builder/component-definitions` modules, and added the bitvocation demo registry file so app-specific entries like `hero-section` and `you-tube-embed` merge cleanly with the shared defaults.

# Next Steps
- Smoke-test the builder interface to confirm the component palette still lists project-specific entries and that new definitions hot-reload correctly.
- Document the pattern for future apps so additional projects can supply their own `content-builder/component-definitions` modules without repeating layer changes.

# Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in docs/specs/bootstrap_content_editor.md. Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time. Ask me for anything that after evalulation, you are not so sure what decision to make. Strive for minimal impact on other areas of the applicaiton. Any time your confidence for taking an actions is < 80%, ask for clarification.

# Plan
1. Clarify MVP scope across the spec sections (component registry, serialization, builder UI) and outline concrete deliverables.
2. Implement the shared component registry and serialization utilities, verifying they align with @nuxt/content expectations.
3. Build a minimal builder page that consumes the registry, manages a node tree, outputs arrays, and previews via `ContentRenderer`.
4. Update the spec with status markers and log the work in implementation results.

# Implementation Summary
- Added strongly typed builder primitives (`app/types/builder.ts`) plus a reusable registry composable (`useComponentRegistry`) that models component metadata, prop schemas, and factory helpers for components/text nodes.
- Created serialization utilities (`app/utils/contentBuilder.ts`) that transform builder trees into ContentRenderer-compatible minimal arrays, handling slot attributes by convention.
- Introduced a basic visual builder at `/builder` leveraging the registry, recursive `NodeEditor` panels for props/children, JSON output, and live preview via `ContentRenderer`.
- Annotated `docs/specs/bootstrap_content_editor.md` with dated status notes for Sections 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, and 3.2.1 to document MVP coverage and remaining UX gaps.

# Next Steps
- Enhance the builder UI with drag-and-drop ordering and richer layout controls to satisfy the full Section 3.1.3 requirements.
- Expand the component registry to cover all custom components envisioned in the spec, including presets and validation for complex props.
- Persist builder state (e.g., to @nuxt/content documents or a SQLite store) and add automated tests for serialization edge cases.

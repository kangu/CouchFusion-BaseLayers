# Initial Prompt
Along Load Debug Data, also include a button for Save Debug Data which should trigger a download for a json file containing the dump of the current entire page object

# Plan
1. Hook up a JSON download helper in the builder workbench.
2. Add a Save button next to Load Debug Data and extend Playwright coverage.

# Implementation Summary
- Added `handleSaveDebugClick` in `app/components/builder/Workbench.vue` to create a JSON blob from the serialized document and trigger a client-side download (filename derived from the document id).
- Extended the Playwright debug-import test to click Save Debug Data and assert the downloaded filename contains `content-debug-page`.

# Next Steps
- Same as prior entry: unblock local dev port before running Playwright for real.

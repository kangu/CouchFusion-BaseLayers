# Initial Prompt
Along Load Debug Data, also include a button for Save Debug Data which should trigger a download for a json file containing the dump of the current entire page object

# Plan
1. Hook up a helper to generate a JSON blob from the current serialized document.
2. Add a Save Debug Data button that downloads the file, and extend Playwright coverage to confirm the download fires.

# Implementation Summary
- `app/components/builder/Workbench.vue` now exposes `handleSaveDebugClick`, generating a JSON blob (naming based on the document id) and triggering a client-side download; styling differentiates the save button.
- Expanded the debug-import Playwright test to click Save Debug Data and assert the downloaded filename contains `content-debug-page`.

# Next Steps
- Consider toggling between JSON download and clipboard copy options if designers request it.
- Once API persistence arrives, reuse the serialization helper to ship payloads server-side.

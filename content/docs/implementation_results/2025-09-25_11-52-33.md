# Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in docs/specs/page_config.md. Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time.

# Plan
1. Review the `page_config` spec and determine which builder configuration fields are required.
2. Update builder serialization and UI code to align with the provided page configuration template.
3. Annotate the spec with completion status and record the implementation results.

# Implementation Summary
- Extended `createDocumentFromTree` (`app/utils/contentBuilder.ts`) with a dedicated `PageConfigInput`, path normalization helpers, and template-aligned fields (`id`, `path`, `navigation`, `seo`, `stem`, etc.).
- Refactored the `/builder` page (`app/pages/builder.vue`) to collect page path/title/SEO/navigation/extension inputs, surface derived `id` and `stem`, and feed the new config into serialization while keeping existing spacing controls.
- Noted the completion in `docs/specs/page_config.md` so future sessions know the template-driven configuration is implemented.

# Next Steps
- Validate behavior by exporting a sample document into @nuxt/content to ensure the generated metadata matches real content needs.
- Consider exposing `meta` editing or presets once page-level metadata requirements expand.
- Update E2E coverage to assert the new configuration inputs (path, navigation) when broader testing scope is prioritized.

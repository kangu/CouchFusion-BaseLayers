# Initial Prompt
Proceed with the implementation. Make sure to document every isContentRoute condition so it can be reviewed later

# Plan
1. Introduce a documented `isContentRoute` helper in the content middleware to skip non-page paths.
2. Update layer documentation to capture the new guard behaviour for future reviewers.

# Implementation Summary
Added route filtering guard to content middleware to skip reserved prefixes, query/hash, and extension segments so only real content pages trigger fetches.

# Next Steps
- Verify via the dev server that requests to assets or `/.well-known` no longer log fetch attempts while standard CMS pages continue to load from CouchDB.
- Share the documented rules with other apps so they can align on acceptable content routes before adding additional prefixes.

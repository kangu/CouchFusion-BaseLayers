# Initial Prompt
Analyse the current project state thoroughly considering all aspects involved , review the past work from /docs and prepare to implement features on it

# Plan
1. Inspect repository layout and key configuration files to understand project structure and tooling.
2. Review documentation in docs/ to capture past work, conventions, and outstanding items.
3. Synthesize findings into actionable insights and preparation notes for upcoming features.

# Implementation Summary
- Captured the current Nuxt 4 setup, including key app, composables, and server API files, noting reliance on @nuxt/content with a placeholder SQLite datastore.
- Verified that dynamic routing presently depends on a stubbed `/api/page` endpoint and local dummy data, surfacing gaps such as misused `ContentRenderer` bindings and static async-data keys.
- Reviewed existing documentation (`initial_review.md`, `bootstrap_content_editor.md`) to understand historical context and the planned visual builder spec that remains unimplemented.

# Next Steps
- Replace stubbed page fetching with real @nuxt/content integration (e.g., using `queryContent`) and clean up the `/api/page` handler accordingly.
- Refactor the `[...slug].vue` page to bind `ContentRenderer` to resolved document data, remove temporary dummy state, and introduce route-aware caching keys.
- Draft the requested PRD expanding on the visual site builder requirements, mapping milestones and deliverables.

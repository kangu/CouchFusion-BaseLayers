# Initial Prompt
Enhance the builder UI with drag-and-drop ordering and richer layout controls.

# Plan
1. Extend builder serialization/types to carry layout metadata (spacing preset) for future consumption.
2. Update the `/builder` page to add spacing preset controls, preview styling, and root-level drag-and-drop reordering.
3. Refresh documentation/spec notes to reflect the new capabilities.

# Implementation Summary
- Added layout metadata support and spacing preset typing in `app/utils/contentBuilder.ts`, allowing serialized documents to persist the selected spacing preset (`layout.spacing`).
- Enhanced `app/pages/builder.vue` with spacing preset controls, preview spacing classes, and HTML5 drag-and-drop handling for reordering root-level nodes, including visual cues and a fallback drop zone.
- Updated the spec status in `docs/specs/bootstrap_content_editor.md` to document the newly delivered builder UI features.

# Next Steps
- Expand drag-and-drop to nested components once child layout controls are defined.
- Persist per-component layout options beyond spacing (e.g., width alignment, background themes) as requirements mature.
- Backfill integration tests (e.g., Playwright) covering drag-and-drop reorder and spacing selection to guard future changes.

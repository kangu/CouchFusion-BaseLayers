# Initial Prompt
Implement the specs in docs/specs/layer_migration.md. Proceed step by step with each section and mark that in the spec document as it's done to be used as reference when resuming work at a future time.

# Plan
1. Assess existing builder assets and outline the required layer extraction scope.
2. Create the `content_layer`, relocate builder functionality, and reconfigure Nuxt to consume the layer.
3. Update documentation with section statuses and record the migration outcome.

# Implementation Summary
- Moved all builder-related components, composables, utils, types, and the stub page API into `layers/content_layer`, leaving the host app with only `app/pages/builder.vue`.
- Added `layers/content_layer/nuxt.config.ts` encapsulating builder modules/components and set the root `nuxt.config.ts` to extend the new layer.
- Updated `docs/specs/layer_migration.md` with status notes per section; noted that verification steps remain pending until the dev server port issue is resolved.

# Next Steps
- Run `npm run dev` and `npm run test:e2e -- builder` once port 5015 is available to validate the layered setup.
- Update broader project documentation (`bootstrap_content_editor.md`, `page_config.md`) to reference the new layer architecture.
- Consider adding layer-level `tsconfig` references if IDE tooling discovers any path resolution gaps post-validation.

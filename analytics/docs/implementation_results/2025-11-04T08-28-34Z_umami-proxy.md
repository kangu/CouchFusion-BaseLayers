# Initial Prompt
Investigate how to include this as a server route in the analytics plugin so the caddy configuration is not needed anymore. The https://cloud.umami.is value should be exposed as a runtime property.

# Implementation Summary
Added a server middleware that proxies `/script.js` and `/api/send` to the configurable Umami host so external Caddy rewrites are no longer required.

# Plan
1. Expose an `analytics.umami.proxyHost` runtime config setting.
2. Create middleware that proxies the script and send endpoints to that host with the correct headers.
3. Document the server-side proxy for consumers.

# Next Steps
- Extend the proxy to additional Umami endpoints if future features require them.
